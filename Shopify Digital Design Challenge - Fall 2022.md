### Fidelity Mobile App UI/UX Study Case
## The Problem
Fidelity is a well-known investment company with a long history, however, the current UI design of Fidelity mobile app has been a struggle for many users.
Based on my extensive user research, it is reflected that the "sell" page is not user friendly in some ways. 
Customer's owned share numbers is not indicated at the trading page and users often have to go back to the front page to memorize the available shares to sell. 
On the other side, the current app design suffers from cluttered pages. 
The current horizontal scrolling system for users's portfolio page might not be the best fit for mobile apps.
Customers are having trouble locating their needed information. 
## My Process

For my process, I started with interviews and surveys with different age groups and occupations background. 
Based on my data collection, a persona and a detailed road map of a customer journey were created to better understand user needs.
Having the previous work as a starting foundation for my design, 
I interatively developed both Lo-FI & Hi-FI prototyping including paper prototypes, task flows, and wireframes with usability tests for evaluation 
to better improve my design. 
After getting much feedback and suggestions on my static prototype, I refined my design and created my interactive [Figma Model](https://www.figma.com/proto/y9RveFfJHq4Isho10OBBuE/Interactive-Mockup?kind=&node-id=201%3A923&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=201%3A923).  
## Solution
- Apply simple interface design throughout the app
- List all stocks vertically instead of horizontal scrolling
- Provide a “sell all” function when users place sell orders
- Create celebration animation after orders are placed, bringing joy and satisfaction to customers
- Allow users to re-order how stocks are listed
- Allow users to customize UIs such as colors, fonts, theme, etc
## Key Results & Success Criteria
- Task success rate
- Task completion time
- Abandonment rate (% of users withdrew their account)
- App satisfaction rate
- App ease-to-use rate
- User growth
- Returning users
## Reflection
### Challenges
The biggest challenge for me was to recreate the visual hierarchy of the interface and to layout the cluttered information display in a aesthetically pleasing design.
### Learnings
While working on this problem, I have learned the important of having simple interfaces. Through out the project, users often had trouble to access needed information
if the page is crowded with too much content. Simple pages with easy to performe action and easy to read elements is favored.   
 In addition, taking fulll advantage of multi-touch screen inputs is a key while designing mobile apps. Using a wide range of smart phone's multi-touch gestures 
 such as taps, swipe, pinch allows users to have the feeling that they are directly interacting with interface elements on the screen, and become more engaged with the product.
### Next Step
If I had more time, I would like to redesign the procedure of buying a stock as the next step.
And I wish to implement more functions such as looking up a stock, adding a wishlist, balance display, etc.
